# Important note about this repository
This repository is meant to be a guide to help you create a yesod project that works with flakes. The guide is the file "Tutorial.md" so please read that before you start questioning what are all the files in this repository (the short answer is that they are all the files your project may generate). I hope this guide helps you in any way and if have a question or comment, feel free to say it.

Now all the information github automatically generates, in case you need it, if not go to `Tutorial.md` and start creating your project.

## Database Setup

After installing Postgres, run:

```
createuser tutorial --pwprompt --superuser
# Enter password tutorial when prompted
createdb tutorial
createdb tutorial_test
```

## Haskell Setup

1. If you haven't already, [install Stack](https://haskell-lang.org/get-started)
	* On POSIX systems, this is usually `curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh`
2. Install the `yesod` command line tool: `stack install yesod-bin --install-ghc`
3. Build libraries: `stack build`

If you have trouble, refer to the [Yesod Quickstart guide](https://www.yesodweb.com/page/quickstart) for additional detail.

## Development

Start a development server with:

```
stack exec -- yesod devel
```

As your code changes, your site will be automatically recompiled and redeployed to localhost.

## Tests

```
stack test --flag tutorial:library-only --flag tutorial:dev
```

(Because `yesod devel` passes the `library-only` and `dev` flags, matching those flags means you don't need to recompile between tests and development, and it disables optimization to speed up your test compile times).

## Documentation

* Read the [Yesod Book](https://www.yesodweb.com/book) online for free
* Check [Stackage](http://stackage.org/) for documentation on the packages in your LTS Haskell version, or [search it using Hoogle](https://www.stackage.org/lts/hoogle?q=). Tip: Your LTS version is in your `stack.yaml` file.
* For local documentation, use:
	* `stack haddock --open` to generate Haddock documentation for your dependencies, and open that documentation in a browser
	* `stack hoogle <function, module or type signature>` to generate a Hoogle database and search for your query
* The [Yesod cookbook](https://github.com/yesodweb/yesod-cookbook) has sample code for various needs

## Getting Help

* Ask questions on [Stack Overflow, using the Yesod or Haskell tags](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/yesod+haskell)
* Ask the [Yesod Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/yesodweb)
* There are several chatrooms you can ask for help:
	* For IRC, try Freenode#yesod and Freenode#haskell
	* [Functional Programming Slack](https://fpchat-invite.herokuapp.com/), in the #haskell, #haskell-beginners, or #yesod channels.
